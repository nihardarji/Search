This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies <br/>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I have used React, Redux and Material UI to build the project.

The additional functionality that is added is favourites. This functionality gives an option to add or remove favourites 
and also display them. The top right corner favourite button is used to display all the favourites.

All the categories are displayed with different colors and search functionality is called by clicking on the search button on the search bar.
